<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is the Capstone project that seals the completion of the JavaScript module in Microverse Curriculum.
It is a platform game. The inspiration was from Zenva and Richard Davey Phaser 3 tutorials.
The principal aim of this game is to collect/swallow the stars. The point increment by 10 each time a star is collected. A bomb and a set of new stars show up as soon as the current set of stars are collected completely.
The player is destroyed the moment s/he collides with the bomb!

### How To Play

    ‚¨ÖÔ∏è  ‚û°Ô∏è
     ‚¨ÜÔ∏è

Basically, the game can played with the Left, the Right and the Up arrow keys only.
To collect the stars and gain points, move the character left with ‚¨ÖÔ∏è key and right with ‚û°Ô∏è key.
To jump, use ‚¨ÜÔ∏è key.
The player should endavour to collect as many stars as possible in order to gain more points.
S/he should also try as much as possible to avoid the the bomb. The player is destroyed the moment s/he collides with the bomb.


### Design Process

Platform Game was designed on an initial, quite complex, webpack configuration specific for Phaser 3. I had to ask questions in order to keep the initial webpack config up and running. The platforms are created with Phaser 3's physics. The Static Physics Group of Phaser 3's physics is completely ideal for platforms as static bodies are not affected by gravity and they do not move when something collides on them. The player actually runs on these platforms.

The player has a set velocity and can move across the platforms by using the arrow keys speified on How To play section.
